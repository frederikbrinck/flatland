Flatland 
========

![Welcome](https://github.com/frederikbrinck/flatland/blob/master/welcome.png)

This is an interactive adaptation of *Flatland: A Romance in Many Dimensions* by Edwin Abbott Abbott developed as a final project for the Explorable Stories course taught by Craig Protzel, New York University Abu Dhabi.

The adaption simplifies the story, but provides interactive elements in which the reader can experience what it is like to live in Flatland. Readers will have to reposition objects from 3D into 2D, compute the angle size of different shapes, and try to recognize objects in Flatland as if the reader was living in 2D by moving with the keyboard. An example of navigating is shown below.
